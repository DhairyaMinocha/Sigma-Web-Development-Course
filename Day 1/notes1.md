# How Do Websites Work?

- The **client** (user) sends a request using the **browser**, which then sends the request to the **server**.
- The **server** processes the request and:
  - Sends the webpage if everything's okay 
  - Sends an error (like 404 or 500) if something's wrong 
- The **browser parses** the HTML received from the server and renders it for the client to see.

# Basic Structure of a HTML 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
 
```
# Backend

- The server side of a website is known as Backend.
- It stores and arranges data and makes sure that everything on client side works fine.
- It is the part of a website that a client can't see and interact with.
- It is the portion of the software that doesn't come in contact with users.
